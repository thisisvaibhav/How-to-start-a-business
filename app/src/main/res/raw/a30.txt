Bakery

If you want to start your own baking business, the most obvious choice would be to open a bakery where you can sell a variety of different creations.
Home Baking Business

Where permitted, you can also start a baking business where you simply make the items in your home kitchen and then sell them online or to local bake shops.
Online Treat Sales

Sites like Etsy allow you to sell cookies and other specialty baked goods from an online shop. Then you can ship those items directly to your customers.
Wholesale Cookie Sales

If you don’t want to start a whole bake shop on your own, you could just sell your creations to local bakeries or coffee shops on a wholesale basis.
Pastry Chef Service

You could also work as a pastry chef either for personal clients or on a freelance basis with local restaurants or bake shops.
Healthy Bake Shop

Baked goods aren’t usually known for their nutritional value. But you can carve out your own unique niche and take advantage of a growing trend by offering some baked goods that are a bit healthier than those found at your average bakery.
Wedding Cake Creation

Wedding cakes are always in high demand. So that can make for a profitable niche for anyone with some baking skills.
Cake Decoration

Or you could get even more specific and offer your services as a cake decorator, making unique creations on wedding cakes and other items.
Cake Sales

You don’t have to specialize only in wedding cakes though. You could simply open a cake shop where you sell items for birthdays and other occasions as well.
Bread Making

Bread is another popular item for bakers. You could open your own bread shop or bake bread for use in various cafe items.
