History
Hike Messenger was launched globally on 12 December 2012 by founder Kavin Bharti Mittal, which over the next couple of months introduced features like free text messaging, themes, stickers, hidden chat option and a revamped user interface.[11] The majority users are from India with 80 percent under the age group of 25.[12] After buying US based free voice calling company Zip Phones in 2015,[13] Hike started providing free voice calling over cellular network and WiFi across the globe before WhatsApp by optimizing voice quality while using low bandwidth which packs more minutes per megabyte (MB) of data.[14] It also purchased startups like TinyMogul and Hoppr in the later part of 2015.[15] After gettting 30 percent sticker usage traffic, Hike launched the 'Great Indian Sticker Challenge' on 5 March 2015 to create more stickers.[16]

With 90 percent of users under the age of 30,[17] the beta testing of Hike messenger app was launched on 6 December 2015 for Windows Phone 8.1 and a Universal Windows Platform app (UWP) for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile.[18] Hike acquired InstaLively Livestreaming Pvt. Ltd in February 2017 which was behind the hyper local social networking app Pulse, that focused on instant audio and video digitization by using lower bandwidth speed which made it cost-effective for enterprises to create and broadcast content from any remote location.[19]

From version 5.0, it became the first social messaging app to start a mobile payment service in India.[20] The timeline feature came back after multiple user requests[21] and introduction of a personalized digital envelope called Blue Packets for sending monetary gifts through built-in wallet.[22] In 2017, acquisition of Bengaluru based startup Creo was announced to enable third-party developers build services on top of Hike platform.[23][24] From 2018, Hike decided to bring 1 billion users online by targeting tier-2 and tier-3 cities by giving more localized services.[25]

The company decided to dump the previous super app approach as of January 2019 and is now looking at launching multiple specialized apps for specific users.[26] In May 2019, Hike announced collaboration with Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-D) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), speech, link prediction, deep learning and computer vision.[27] The company launched the first standalone app Hike Sticker Chat in April 2019, while a separate content app is now called Hike News & Content. With the help of machine learning, Hike Sticker Chat can now recommend, suggest and smartly predicts custom stickers for different situations and mood.[28][29]

Hike launched an animated sticker for Valentine's Day 2019 with a special pack for the LGBTQ community.[30]

Due to multilingual nature of Indian society, qwerty keyboards are difficult to localize so Hike is planning to use machine learning to make 80 to 90 percent of sticker-based chat a keyboard-less affair with the help of predictive analysis which now stands at 20 to 30 percent of user conversations on the platform. Hike stickers cover only 15 to 20 percent of vocabulary across 40 languages in India with future focus on text messages and symbols to achieve 100 percent prediction rate that gives a seamless experience while reducing keyboard dependency.[31]

Hike is creating a smaller smart team of employees in the year 2020 with game designers, crypto-economists and psychologists to understand the emerging digital landscape and create a new type of block-chain economy for its newly launched service called Hike Land.[32][33]

In a survey done by the Hike team out of a million active users, 69 percent confirmed that they like to talk to others without sharing their own phone number and over 72 percent said that they like to skip the step of saving phone numbers before talking to others. This is what prompted the developers to come up with Hike ID as the solution which makes it easier as well as secure for users to chat without having to share or save phone numbers.[66]
