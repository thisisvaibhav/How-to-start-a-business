CPS STAGE'S

There are six stages of creative problem solving

1.The Objective Finding Stage

This stage employs divergent thinking to list the problems. Convergence is then used to identify the relevant areas for further discussion. 
‘Hits’ and ‘hotspots’ are identified finding priorities, importance of the problem, its urgency, and its nature.

2. The Fact Finding Stage

Next is the fact-finding stage, where understanding of the problem is increased by collating of relevant information.
 This also helps new ideas to be generated. ‘Hits’ and ‘hotspots’ help to see the problem in a new light.

3. The Problem Finding Stage

In this stage, all the previous-stage ‘hits’ are used to identify the most productive problem listings.

4. The Idea Finding Stage

In this stage, creative problem solving teams look for potential solutions. Mainly divergent activity is used to bring out many ideas using idea-generation aids.

5. The Solution Finding Stage

All the implementable ideas are filtered out and their feasibilities are checked.

6. The Acceptance Finding Stage

It is a divergent activity that helps to implement solutions successfully via −

Listing possible hurdles and ways to overcome them
Developing implementation and contingency plans
Generating Action Plans for working
Many people get used to traditional ideas, and this is often one of the main barriers to creative problem solving. Because of this thought, people and organizations tend to fall into a variety of traps when trying to become more innovative.
