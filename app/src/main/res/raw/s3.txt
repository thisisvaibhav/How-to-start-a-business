On August 19, 2020, Airbnb announced that it had filed for an initial public offering. The company has been privately valued at $31 billion.

Joe Gebbia, Airbnb founder (right)
Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October 2007, roommates and former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia came up with the idea of putting an air mattress in their living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast.[9] In February 2008, Nathan Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, which they named AirBed & Breakfast.[9][10] They put together a website that offered short-term living quarters, breakfast, and a business networking opportunity for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market.[9] The site Airbedandbreakfast.com officially launched on August 11, 2008.[11][12] The founders had their first customers in town in the summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time finding lodging in the city.[13]

Computer programmer Paul Graham invited the founders to the January 2009 winter training session of his startup incubator, Y Combinator, which provided them with training and funding in exchange for a small interest in the company.[14][15][16] With the website already built, they used the Y-Combinator investment to fly to New York to meet users and promote the site.[citation needed] They returned to San Francisco with a profitable business model to present to West Coast investors. By March 2009, the site had 10,000 users and 2,500 listings.[16]

In March 2009, the name of the company was shortened to Airbnb.com, and the site's content had expanded from air beds and shared spaces to a variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, and other properties.[17]

In April 2009, the company received seed money from Sequoia Capital. In November 2010, they raised financing from Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital in a Series A round, and announced that out of 700,000 nights booked, 80% had occurred in the previous six months.[18]

In July 2014, Airbnb revealed design revisions to the site and mobile app and introduced a new logo.

In the summer of 2016, at the request of three members of the United States Senate, the Federal Trade Commission began investigating how Airbnb affected housing costs. In October 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill charging Airbnb fines for violations of local housing laws.

Overview
Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities.[83] Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price, and can search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes.[83][84][85] Before booking, users must provide personal and payment information.[83] Some hosts also require a scan of government-issued identification before accepting a reservation.[86] Guests can chat with hosts through a secure messaging system.[84] Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental or event listings, such as the allowed number of guests, home type, rules, and amenities.[83][84] Hosts and guests have the ability to leave reviews about the experience.[83]

Regulations
Europe
Several European cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam,[105] Paris, and Venice have enhanced regulations for short-term rentals such as Airbnb to address the increase in the cost of living for locals, as well as the disturbances caused by tourism.[106][107][108][109]

In Ireland, laws were introduced to require a change in planning permission for short-term lets, restricting landlords to renting a short-term let for a maximum of 90 days per year for primary residences and requiring registration by landlords with local authorities. Despite this, only a minority of landlords offering properties on Airbnb actually registered by end 2019, prompting calls for stricter enforcement.[110]

United States
In the United States, Washington, D.C.,[111] Los Angeles,[112] Santa Monica, San Francisco, Charleston, and New York have imposed restrictions. Jersey City, New Jersey has the most listings in the state and the number one destination for Airbnb[113][114] and is also considered part of the New York City Airbnb market. A November 2019 referendum (originally supported by Airbnb)[115][116] approved regulations for short-term rentals which are considered the most stringent in United States.,[117][118] allowing for only 60 rental days per year.[119]

Japan
In 2018, Japan created new regulations regarding home-sharing, which includes hosts registering and limiting the numbers of days a home can be rented to 180.
