CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

Core Principles of Creative Problem Solving

1. Divergent and convergent thinking must be balanced.
 
The key to creativity is learning how to identify and balance divergent and convergent thinking (done separately), and knowing when to practice each one.

2. Ask problems as questions.

 When you rephrase problems and challenges as open-ended questions with multiple possibilities, it's easier to come up with solutions.
 Asking these types of questions generates lots of rich information, while asking closed questions tends to elicit short answers, such as confirmations or disagreements.
 Problem statements tend to generate limited responses, or none at all.

3. Defer or suspend judgment.
 
As Alex Osborn learned from his work on brainstorming, judging solutions early on tends to shut down idea generation.
 Instead, there's an appropriate and necessary time to judge ideas during the convergence stage.

4. Focus on "Yes, and," rather than "No, but."

 Language matters when you're generating information and ideas. "Yes, and" encourages people to expand their thoughts,
 which is necessary during certain stages of CPS. Using the word "but" – preceded by "yes" or "no" – ends conversation, and often negates what's come before it.
