CLASIFICATION OF COMPANY

Primary Classification

Companies are primarily classified into private and public. Private companies or private limited companies are those companies that are closely-held and have less than 200 shareholders. 
Public companies are limited companies that have more than 200 shareholders and are listed on a stock exchange.

The 2013 Act has brought with it a new form of a company entitled One Person Company (OPC), which in theory is a private company. 
As can be deciphered from the name, a One Person Company requires only one member to form it. The person forming an OPC must be a natural person, 
a citizen of India and an Indian resident during the time of formation. A minor can never be a member or a nominee of a member in OPC. OPC provides an opportunity 
for the sole proprietors to reap the benefits of limited liability by becoming a corporate entity.

Classification on the Basis of Control

Companies, on the basis of control, are classified as follows:

  1. Holding company.
  2. Associate company.

Holding Company

The relationship of holding or subsidiary companies is established either with the control of Board of Directors or control of share capital. A company will be a holding company of another in the following scenarios:

  1. Controls the composition of the Board of Directors of the other company.
  2. Exercises or controls more than 50% of the total share capital either on its own or together with one or more of its subsidiary companies.

Associate Company

If a company has significant influence over another company, the latter will be the Associated Company of the first company. 
Significant influence is derived either from control of at-least 20% of the total share capital, or of business decisions under an agreement.
