Uber

Uber Technologies, Inc., commonly known as Uber, offers vehicles for hire, food delivery (Uber Eats), package delivery, couriers, freight transportation, and, through a partnership with Lime, electric bicycle and motorized scooter rental. The company is based in San Francisco and has operations in over 900 metropolitan areas worldwide.[2] It is one of the largest providers in the gig economy and is also a pioneer in the development of self-driving cars.

Uber is estimated to have over 110 million monthly active users worldwide.[6] In the United States, Uber has a 67% market share for ride-sharing[7] and a 24% market share for food delivery.[8] Uber has been so prominent in the sharing economy that the changes in industries as a result of it have been referred to as uberisation,[9][10][11] and many startups have described their products as "Uber for X".[12][13][14]

Like similar companies, Uber has been criticized for treatment of drivers as independent contractors, disruption of the taxicab business, and an increase of traffic congestion. When it was under the leadership of former CEO Travis Kalanick, the company was criticized for several unethical practices.

Product overview
Uber uses a dynamic pricing model; prices vary according to supply and demand at the time of service. However, customers are quoted the fare or delivery fee in advance.[15][16]

Service is generally accessed via mobile app. Users set up a personal profile with a name, phone number, other information, and payment preference, which could be a credit card, e-commerce payment system or, in some cases, cash. After the service is complete, the customer may be given the option to provide a gratuity to the driver, which is also billed to the customer's payment method.

The status of drivers as independent contractors is an unresolved issue. Drivers provide a vehicle, which could be owned, rented, or leased. Drivers must meet requirements for age, health, car age and type, have a driver's license and a smartphone or tablet, and may be required to pass a background check. In many cities, vehicles must pass annual safety inspections and/or must have an emblem posted in the passenger window. Some cities also require drivers to have a business license.[17] There may be accommodations for hearing-impaired drivers.[18] Drivers may be notified before accepting a trip if it will be longer than 45 minutes. After each transaction, drivers and customers may rate each other and users with low ratings may be deactivated.[19]

Service options
UberX, the basic level of service, includes a private ride in a standard car with driver for up to four passengers. Depending on the location, Uber offers various other levels of transportation service at different prices including: black luxury vehicles, newer or premium level vehicles, cars with leather seats, sport utility vehicles, minivan, vans, Suzuki Altos, hatchbacks, electric cars, hybrid vehicles, motorcycles, auto rickshaws, actual taxicabs, lower-cost shared transport with other passengers going in the same general direction (suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic), child safety seats, pet shipping, guaranteed Spanish language-speaking drivers, additional assistance to senior citizens and passengers with a physical disability, and wheelchair accessible vans.[20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]

Persons with a service animal may use any type of Uber service, as required by law.

Through a partnership with Lime, users are able to rent Jump electric bicycles and motorized scooters.[34][35][36]

Uber offers health professionals in the United States a HIPAA-compliant method to arrange rides for patients to-and-from their appointments. Patients without smartphones can receive pickup information via Text messaging or via the health professional's office.[37]

Air services
Operated by HeliFlite, Uber Copter offers 8-minute helicopter flights between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport for approximately $200 per passenger.[38]

UberAir, under development, will provide short flights using VTOL aircraft. Demonstration flights are projected to start in 2020 in Dallas and Los Angeles. Commercial operations are projected to begin in 2023.[39]

Uber Freight
Uber Freight matches freight shippers with truckers in a similar fashion to the matching of passengers with drivers.[40][41]

Boat transportation
In partnership with local operators, Uber offered boat transportation during peak season in several locations including Croatia,[42] Miami,[43][44] and Istanbul.[45]

History
Further information: Timeline of Uber

Travis Kalanick, former CEO of Uber, in 2013
In 2009, Uber was founded as Ubercab by Garrett Camp, a computer programmer and the co-founder of StumbleUpon, and Travis Kalanick, who sold his Red Swoosh startup for $19 million in 2007.[46]

After Camp and his friends spent $800 hiring a private driver, he wanted to find a way to reduce the cost of direct transportation. He realized that sharing the cost with people could make it affordable, and his idea morphed into Uber. Kalanick joined Camp and gives him "full credit for the idea" of Uber.[47] The first prototype was built by Camp and his friends, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan, with Kalanick as the "mega advisor" to the company.[47]

Following a beta launch in May 2010, Uber's services and mobile app officially launched in San Francisco in 2011.[48][49] Originally, the application only allowed users to hail a black luxury car and the price was 1.5 times that of a taxi.[50][51]

In February 2010, Ryan Graves became the first Uber employee. Graves started out as general manager and was named CEO shortly after the launch.[47] In December 2010, Kalanick succeeded Graves as the CEO of Uber.[47][48][52][53] Graves became the company's chief operating officer (COO).[54] By 2019, Graves owned 31.9 million shares in the company.[55]

In 2011, the company changed its name from UberCab to Uber after complaints from San Francisco taxicab operators.[56][57]

The company's early hires included a nuclear physicist, a computational neuroscientist, and a machinery expert who worked on predicting demand for private hire car drivers and where demand is highest.[46][58] In April 2012, Uber launched a service in Chicago where users were able to request a regular taxi or an Uber driver via its mobile app.[59][60]

In July 2012, the company introduced UberX, a cheaper option that allows people to drive for Uber using non-luxury vehicles, including their personal vehicles, subject to a background check, registration requirement, and car standards.[61][57] By early 2013, the service was operating in 35 cities.[62][63][64]

In December 2013, USA Today named Uber its tech company of the year.[65]

In August 2014, Uber launched UberPOOL, a shared transport service in the San Francisco Bay Area.[66][67] The service soon launched in other cities worldwide including Paris,[68] New York City,[69] China,[70] Washington, D.C.,[71] London,[72] Boston,[73] Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Singapore,[74][75] Delaware,[76] Toronto,[77] Nashville,[78] Sydney,[79] and Melbourne.[80]

In August 2014, Uber launched Uber Eats, a food delivery service.


Self-driving car research

Uber autonomous vehicle Volvo XC90 in San Francisco
Advanced Technologies Group (Uber ATG) is a subsidiary of the company that is developing self-driving cars. Uber ATG is minority-owned by Softbank Vision Fund, Toyota, and Denso.[118]

In early 2015, the company hired approximately 50 people from the robotics department of Carnegie Mellon University.[119]

On September 14, 2016, Uber launched its first self-driving car services to select customers in Pittsburgh, using a fleet of Ford Fusion cars. Each vehicle was equipped with 20 cameras, seven lasers, Global Positioning System, lidar, and radar equipment that enabled the car to create a three-dimensional map.[120][121]

On December 14, 2016, Uber began using self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs in its hometown of San Francisco.[122] On December 21, 2016, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration of the vehicles Uber was using for the test and forced the program to cease operations in California.[123] Two months later, Uber moved the program to Arizona, where the cars were able to pick up passengers, although, as a safety precaution, two Uber engineers were always in the front seats of each vehicle.[124] In March 2017, an Uber self-driving car was hit and flipped on its side by another vehicle that failed to yield.[125] In October 2017, Uber started using only one test driver, despite some employees' safety concerns.[126]

In November 2017, Uber announced a non-binding plan to buy up to 24,000 Volvo XC90 SUV vehicles designed to accept autonomous technology, including a different type of steering and braking mechanism and sensors.[127][128]

Incidents
See also: List of self-driving car fatalities
In March 2018, there was a temporary pause to Uber's self-driving vehicle testing after the death of Elaine Herzberg by an Uber self-driving vehicle in Tempe, Arizona.[129] According to police, the woman was struck by the Uber vehicle while attempting to cross the street, while the Uber engineer in the vehicle was watching videos on her phone.[129] Uber pulled its self-driving cars off all public roads[130] and reached a settlement with the victim's family.[131] There was disagreement among local authorities as to whether or not the car or the victim was at fault.[132] In December 2018, after receiving local approval, Uber restarted testing of its self driving cars, only during daylight hours and at slower speeds, in Pittsburgh[133][134] and Toronto.[135] In March 2019, Uber was found not criminally liable by Yavapai County Attorney's Office for the death of Herzberg.[136] The company changed its approach to self-driving vehicles after Herzberg's death, inviting both Waymo and General Motors’ Cruise self-driving vehicle unit to operate vehicles on Uber’s ride-hailing network.[137] In February 2020, Uber regained the permit to test self-driving vehicles on public roads of California with backup drivers and announced plans to resume testing in San Francisco.[138]

Timing
In September 2016, Uber projected the potential operation of 75,000 autonomous vehicles in 13 cities by 2022 and that 13,000 autonomous Uber vehicles could be operating by 2019.[139] In April 2019, Uber scientist Raquel Urtasun offered a more cautious estimate of the company’s eventual self-driving capabilities, saying "self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet. To have it at scale is going to take a long time."[137]

Research and development spending
In early 2019, Uber spent $20 million per month on research and development for autonomous vehicles;[139] however, a source said that expenses on the autonomous vehicle program have been as high as $200 million per quarter.[137]

Cancellation of research on autonomous trucks
After spending over $925 million to develop autonomous trucks, Uber cancelled its self-driving truck program in July 2018.[40] Uber acquired Otto for $625 million in 2016.[140][141] According to a February 2017 lawsuit filed by Waymo, owned by an affiliate of Google, ex-Google employee Anthony Levandowski allegedly "downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo's highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation" before resigning to found Otto, which was purchased by Uber.[142][143] A ruling in May 2017 required Uber to return documents to Waymo.[144] The trial began February 5, 2018.[145] A settlement was announced on February 8, 2018 in which Uber gave Waymo $244 million in Uber equity and agreed not to infringe on Waymo's intellectual property.[146]

Criticism

Classification of drivers as independent contractors
Unless otherwise required by law, drivers are generally independent contractors and not employees. This designation affects taxation, work hours, and overtime benefits. Lawsuits have been filed by drivers alleging that they are entitled to the rights and remedies of being considered "employees" under employment law.[147] However, drivers do receive certain flexibilities that are not common among employees.[148]

In O'Connor v. Uber Technologies, a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16, 2013, Uber drivers pleaded that according to the California Labor Code they should be classified as employees and receive reimbursement of business expenses such as gas and vehicle maintenance costs. In March 2019, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle the case.[149]

On October 28, 2016, in the case of Aslam v Uber BV, the Central London Employment tribunal ruled that Uber drivers are "workers", not self-employed, and are entitled to the minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, paid holiday, and other entitlements.[150] Two Uber drivers had brought the test case to the employment tribunal with the assistance of the GMB Union, on behalf of a group of drivers in London.[151] Uber appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; a hearing took place on 21 July 2020.[152]

In March 2018, the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research of Switzerland ruled that drivers should be classified as employees.[153]

In April 2018, the Supreme Court of California ruled in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court that Dynamex, a delivery company, misclassified its delivery drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.[154] This ultimately led to California passing Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) on September 11, 2019, with a test to determine if a tasker must be classified as an employee and receive minimum wage protections and unemployment benefits. A referendum to provide exemptions is scheduled for a vote in November 2020.[155] In December 2019, Uber and Postmates sued California, claiming AB5 is unconstitutional.[156]

In November 2019, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development determined that drivers should be classified as employees and fined Uber $650 million for overdue unemployment and disability insurance taxes.[157]

Compliance with minimum wage laws
In some jurisdictions, drivers are guaranteed a minimum wage, such as in New York City, where drivers must earn $26.51/hour before expenses or $17.22/hour after expenses. Analyses have shown that absent such laws, many drivers earn less than the stated minimum wage.[158] A May 2018 report by the Economic Policy Institute found the average hourly wage for drivers to be $9.21.[159] Reports of poor wages have been published in Profil,[160] Trend,[161] and The Guardian.[162] A 2017 report claimed that only 4% of all Uber drivers were still working as such one year after starting, primarily due to low pay.[163]

However, a 2019 study found that "drivers earn more than twice the surplus they would in less-flexible arrangements."[164]

Dynamic pricing and price fixing allegations
Due to dynamic pricing models, prices for the same route may vary based on the supply and demand for rides at the time the ride is requested.[165] When rides are in high demand in a certain area and there are not enough drivers in such area, fares increase to get more drivers to that area.[166][167] In some cases, this resulted in extreme surcharges during emergencies such as Hurricane Sandy,[168] the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis,[169] and the 2017 London Bridge attack.[170]

In the United States, drivers do not have any control over the fares they charge; lawsuits allege that this is an illegal restraint on trade in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.[171][172]

Safety concerns
It is unclear if rideshare vehicles are less or more safe than taxicabs. Major cities in the United States don't have much data on taxi-related incidents. However, in London, taxi drivers were responsible for 5 times the number of incidents of sexual assault as compared to Uber drivers.[173] Crimes have been committed by rideshare drivers[174] as well as by individuals posing as rideshare drivers who lure unsuspecting passengers to their vehicles by placing an emblem on their car or by claiming to be a passenger's expected driver.[175] The latter led to the Murder of Samantha Josephson and the introduction of Sami’s Law. Lawsuits claim that rideshare companies did not take necessary measures to prevent sexual assault.[176][177]

Rideshare companies have been fined by government agencies for violations in their background check processes.[178][179][180]

In November 2019, Transport for London did not renew Uber's license to operate due in part to the ability of people to fake identities and use other drivers' accounts, circumventing the background check process.[181][182][183]

Increased traffic congestion, carbon emissions, and reduced usage of public transport
Studies have shown that traffic congestion has increased in New York City and San Francisco, where extensive public transport networks are in place.[184][185][186][187] Many people who use these services would otherwise be using public transport.[188] Taxicabs were noted to have lower rider waiting time and vehicle empty driving time, and thus contribute less to congestion and pollution in downtown areas.[189] However, another report noted that these companies serve as complements to public transit.[190]

In 2020, the Union of Concerned Scientists found that due to dead mileage, "ride-hailing trips produce 47 percent more carbon emissions than a similar trip taken in your own private car."[191]

Insufficient wheelchair accessible vans
In some areas, vehicle for hire companies are required by law to have a certain amount of wheelchair accessible vans (WAVs) in use. However, most drivers do not own a WAV, making it hard to comply with the laws.[192]

Driver refusals to transport service animals
While companies have strict requirements to transport service animals, drivers have been criticized for refusal to transport service animals, which, in the United States, is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In one case, this resulted in a lawsuit, which was referred to arbitration.[193][194]

Use of phones while driving
To accept a fare, drivers must tap their phone screen, usually within 15 seconds after receiving a notification, which is illegal in some jurisdictions since it could result in distracted driving.[195]

Decline in value of taxi medallions
Values of taxi medallions, transferable permits or licenses authorizing the holder to pick up passengers for hire, have declined in value significantly. A couple of credit unions that lent money secured by medallions suffered from bank failure.[196]

Antitrust price fixing allegations
Uber has been a subject of several antitrust legal cases. Antitrust law generally holds that price setting activities are permissible within business firms, but bars them beyond firm boundaries. Uber does not actually provide services to consumers directly, instead, drivers are independent contractors and not employees. The antitrust law’s firm exemption strictly applies to entities that a platform have a direct control over, such as employees. The core of Uber’s business model is the coordination of consumer prices across drivers as means to deliver upfront fares calculated by an algorithm. Uber has managed to avoid directly litigating this antitrust problem by compelling a consumer (Meyer v. Uber Technologies, Inc.) lawsuit to be moved into arbitration.[197]

In the 1951 antitrust case United States v. Richfield Oil Co., the court ruled unequivocally for the government on the grounds that Richfield Oil Co. exercised de facto control over “independent business men,” in contravention of the antitrust laws, despite the fact that they were not employees of the company. This has become the basis for delineation between the realm of labor and antitrust: if subordinate entities are “independent business men” and not employees, it is illegal to exercise control. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the same basic principle against coercion of non-employees by vertical supply contract in the 1964 case Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of California.
