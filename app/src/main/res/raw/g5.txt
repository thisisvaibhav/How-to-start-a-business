MORAL DECISION MAKING

A moral decision is a decision made in a way so that action or inaction conforms to one's morals. ... Morals are acquired (learned or self-developed) 
rules of behavior categorized into 'right' or 'wrong', where the rules typically omit context and nuance.


How We Make Moral Decisions

Imagine you are hiding from enemy soldiers in a basement, with several other people — friends, family, neighbours. 
You can hear the soldiers walking overhead, and any sound will alert them to your presence, leading to everyone’s death. In your arms is your infant child, 
who is about to cry. Do you hold your hand over his mouth, smothering him but saving everyone you are with, or do you let him cry, 
knowing that doing so will result in the death of not only the baby, but everyone in the basement?

Dilemmas like this, beloved of philosophers and psychologists who work on moral decision-making, may be far-fetched, but they illustrate important 
discrepancies between our immediate reactions and logical reasoning that we often find difficult, if not impossible, to resolve. While ethics has a long history in 
philosophy, recent research in psychology has brought a new perspective to issues of moral behaviour and decision-making.
