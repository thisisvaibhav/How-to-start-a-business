How to apply for a loan against property: A step by step guide

- Find out the maximum loan amount

Once you have zeroed-in on prospective lenders, find the maximum loan amount you can avail. The loan amount depends on your property’s market value and the maximum amount you can avail differs across lenders. 

For instance, Bajaj Finserv Loan Against Property for salaried and self-employed individuals can go up to Rs.1 crore or Rs.3.5 crore respectively.

- Check the eligibility criteria

Every lender has a specific eligibility criterion that you need to fulfill. You need to be an Indian resident, either salaried or self-employed, within a certain age bracket. 

You also need to submit a few documents like identity and address proof, bank account statement of past months, proof of ownership of the property to be pledged as collateral, IT returns, etc., along with the loan application.

- Fill the application form

You have two options to apply for a loan against property - online or offline. If you wish to apply offline, you need to physically visit the nearest branch office of your lender with all the required documents. For online application, fill the Application Form of Loan Against Property along with the relevant documents and the lender would get in touch with you.
