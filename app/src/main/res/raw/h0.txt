WHAT IS TEAM BULDING

Team building is the process of turning a group of individual contributing employees into a cohesive team.\n'
A team is a group of people organized to work together interdependently and cooperatively to meet the needs of their customers by accomplishing their purpose and goals.

Daily Team Building Opportunities

Team building can include the daily interaction that employees engage in when working together to carry out the requirements of their jobs. This form of team building is natural and can be assisted if the group takes the time needed to come up with a set of team norms. The norms help group members know how to appropriately interact on the team and with the rest of the organization.
Team building can also involve structured activities and exercises that employees on the team can lead, one way in which team norms are established. Or, with the proper budget and goals, managers can contract out for facilitation with an external resource. External facilitation, by an experienced person, can give your team building a boost.
No matter how you choose to build your group of employees into a team, the resulting bonds will enable them to accomplish the work and goals of your organization more effectively than a non-bonded group. As long as your focus is dedicated to team building opportunities that lend themselves to the accomplishment of the actual work of the team, you are effectively building a team.
