TEAM LEADERSHIP

What Makes a Good Team Leader in Business?

Leadership Skills

 While leadership skills may be the most difficult to quantify, they are also arguably the most important ones a business team leader must possess.
 Leadership skills encompass basic communication and professional skills, but they go a step further to include the ability to delegate fairly and effectively,
 the ability to inspire a team even in the face of setbacks, the ability to find and nurture the strengths of each team member and the ability to smooth conflicts among team members without taking sides.

Time-Management Skills

 Managing time effectively, both on a minute-by-minute level during the day and on a broader level, makes it possible to keep a team on schedule. 
 For example, a good team leader tracks the efforts of each team member to make sure project timelines are adhered to, a
 ccomplishes his own tasks efficiently and ensures that meetings have agendas to avoid wasting time in drawn-out discussions.
