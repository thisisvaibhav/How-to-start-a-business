ENTREPRENEURSHIP INTRODUCTION

What is Entrepreneurship?

Entrepreneurship is both the study of how new businesses are created as well as the actual process of starting a new business – the term is used interchangeably. 
An entrepreneur is someone who has an idea and who works to create a product or service that people will buy, by building an organization to support those sales.

Start-ups

Starting a business generally requires:

1. A business concept or idea involving a product, service, process, or new technology
2. People to support the work, whether as employees, vendors, or advisors
3. A process by which the product or service will be delivered, or the technology will be developed
4. Enough money to support the development of the idea to the point that it generates revenue
